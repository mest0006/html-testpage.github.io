  <p> The raccoon (/rəˈkuːn/ or US: /ræˈkuːn/ (About this soundlisten), Procyon lotor) is a medium-sized mammal native
    to North America. The raccoon is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to
    28
    in) and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur which <br>
    insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous
    front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of
    the Americas. Raccoons are noted for their intelligence, with studies showing that they are able to remember the
    solution to tasks for at least three years. They are usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40%
    invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates. <br>

    The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability they have
    extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them
    to
    be pests. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also
    distributed across much of mainland Europe, Caucasus, and Japan. <br>

    Though previously thought to be generally solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in sex-specific
    social behavior. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to
    four raccoons to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and other potential
    invaders. Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares (7.4 acres) for females in cities to 5,000 hectares
    (12,000
    acres) for males in prairies. After a gestation period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as "kits", are
    born in spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall. Although captive
    raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years. In
    many
    areas, hunting and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death.</p </body> <hr>
